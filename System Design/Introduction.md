Many applications are data-intensive as opposed to compute-intensive (ie. problems stem from the amount of data, complexity of data, and the speed it's changing)

Data-intensive applications need to support:
- store data
- cache data
- index data
- stream process
- batch process

Reliability: System should continue to work correctly even through adversity
Scalability: As the system grows, there should be ways to cope with that growth
Maintainability: Maintain current behavior and adapt to new features
