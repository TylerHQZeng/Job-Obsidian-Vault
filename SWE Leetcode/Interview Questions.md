• Web Applications/Web Programming, Frontend, Backend, UI/UX, (Internship): Developed a social platform for medical professionals using React for the frontend, Python and TypeScript for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and Playwright for testing. Configured STUN servers, ICE candidates, peer connection protocols, and Session Description Protocol signaling to enable peer-to-peer video calling via WebRTC. Gained UX/UI and data engineering experience by conducting user research, wireframing in Figma, A/B testing, and writing ETL scripts.
• Algorithms and Theory (Internship): Optimized real-time microservice performance by applying bzip2 lossless compression to messages and migrating event producers from PostgreSQL change data captures to supabase broadcasts, reducing latency per comment sent by approximately 75%.
• Compilers (Class project): Built a compiler for a subset of the C language (with memory management and user I/O) with simplified maximal munch tokenization and SLR(1) parsing. Optimized with tail recursion, constant folding, and constant propagation, and linked code with Waterloo’s .merl assembler.
• Computer Vision, Graphics, Research, ML/AI (Research): Used Project Aria smart glasses to predict caloric consumption using computer vision and computer graphics. Using segmented food images and SLAM data, applied 3D reconstruction to generate polyhedral models. This enabled integration of the enclosed region to extract volumetric data. Complemented computer vision with a pipeline that processed inertial movement and audio data, extracting frequency features for a random forest classifier to detect chewing.
• Algorithms, Software Systems (Project): Created an OOP-based chess game, implementing MVC, decorator, and observer patterns, with a bot using alpha-beta pruning for move generation.
